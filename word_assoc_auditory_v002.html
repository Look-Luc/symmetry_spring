            This is an experiment in which you will be asked to watch short videos and answer brief questions
            about them. It should take around 8-10 minutes to complete and you will receive 0.5 credits for your time.
            <br><br>

          <p>In this study, you will choose which of two actions best describes a video.</p>

          <p>On each trial, you will watch a video in which two shapes will move. The video will repeat once. Then two phrases will be displayed.</p>

          <p><strong>Your job is to choose between Bounce/Stream you think best matches the video. There is no correct or incorrect answer. <em>Go with your gut!</em></strong></p>

          <p><strong>Also, sometimes you will hear sound during the videos, so it is important you keep your headphones on at normal volume during the study, and do not listen to anything else, like music.</strong></p>

          <p>We will be looking at the concept of "bounce" and "stream".  Bounce is when the two objects look like they hit each other
            like they bounce so to speak.  Below is an example of bounce:
          </p>
          <img src="media/bounce_example.png" alt="Bounce example" width="300" height="300">
          <p>Stream is when the two objects pass each other or phase each other.  Below is an example of stream:</p>
          <img src="media/stream_example.png" alt="Stream example" width="300" height="300">

          <p>The whole study will only take about 8-10 minutes; please stay focused!</p>
