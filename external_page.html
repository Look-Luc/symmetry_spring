    <strong>CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Title of Study: </strong>Studies of Human Perception, Language, and Cognition
    <br>
    <strong>Principal Investigator(s): </strong>Dr. Alon Hafri, Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science

    Important aspects of the study you should know about:
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of the study is to examine the link between what we see and how we describe 
        it â€” and in turn what this can tell us about how we conceptualize the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedures</strong>: If you choose to participate, you will complete a simple task: You will be asked 
        to look at, describe, sort, or remember things you see or hear. These things will include pictures, videos, 
        sounds, or words and sentences. The tasks will be presented on a computer screen. If you participate in this 
        experiment online, the tasks will be presented via your web browser. Responses will be made using a keyboard, 
        mouse, and/or microphone. If in-person, responses may also be made using a button box. We will record your 
        responses, how quickly you respond, and any verbal descriptions you provide. We may also ask you basic questions 
        about yourself (e.g., your age, gender, and/or language background). After you finish the experiment, we will ask 
        you about your experience. Before we start, we will explain the instructions to you clearly, and you can ask 
        questions at any time (if you are participating online, you can contact the experimenter by email or through 
        the messaging system on the online recruitment platform).</li>
    <li><strong>Duration</strong>: This session will last about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Risks</strong>: Possible risks of participating in this research study are no greater than those 
        encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits</strong>: There are no direct benefits to you for participation. However, your participation 
        may contribute to our understanding of how perception, language, and cognition work.</li>
    <li><strong>Costs and Compensation</strong>: f you decide to participate, there will be no additional cost to you. 
        If you are participating for pay, you will be compensated $1.67 per hour. Online participants recruited via a 
        platform such as MTurk, Prolific, or naodao will be paid through the platform's compensation system; otherwise, 
        online participants will receive an electronic Amazon gift card as payment.

        If you are participating in this study for an academic course, you may receive extra credit per the course 
        instructor's predetermined specifications. (If you choose not to participate or to terminate participation early, 
        an alternative extra-credit option will be made available to you.)

    <li><strong>Participation</strong>: Taking part or not in this research study is your decision. You can decide to
